<h1>Architecture of vncip</h1>

<p>
The <b>vncip</b> responder is a system of Perl scripts and modules whose task
is to receive incoming NCIP version 1 requests, figure out what to do with each
request, do it (or ask Voyager to do it), build an appropriate response, and
send the response back to the initiator.

<p>
Most of what <b>vncip</b> does is delegated to Voyager using SQL queries run
against the Oracle database that stores Voyager&rsquo;s data or via the
extended SIP2 interface that Voyager provides.  For example, checking out an
item to a patron requires gathering information about the patron and the item
using SQL, then using SIP to ask Voyager to check the item out.

<p>
The code that makes up <b>vncip</b> is divided among several principal
components:

<dl>
<dt><b>ncipd</b></dt>
<dd><p>
    The NCIP1 <i>daemon</i> &ndash; this script runs continually and
    &ldquo;drives&rdquo; all of the other components.
<dt><b>ncipctl</b></dt>
<dd><p>
    A shell script to start and stop <b>ncipd</b>.
<dt><b>Biblio::NCIP1::Responder</b></dt>
<dd><p>
    The main Perl module, which provides the &ldquo;responder&rdquo; proper.
    The responder coordinates the other Perl modules.
<dt><b>Biblio::NCIP1::Server</b></dt>
<dd><p>
    A Perl module that listens for incoming connections on the desired network
    port, reads requests that come in, and passes them off to the
    <b>Biblio::NCIP1::Responder</b> object.
<dt><b>Biblio::NCIP1:Request</b></dt>
<dd><p>
    The Perl module that embodies an NCIP1 request.  It is responsible for
    parsing the XML that comes in from the NCIP initiator.
<dt><b>Biblio::NCIP1:Response</b></dt>
<dd><p>
    The Perl module that embodies an NCIP1 response.  It is responsible for
    building the XML that will be sent back to the initiator.
<dt><b>Biblio::NCIP1:Backend::Vger8</b></dt>
<dd><p>
    A Perl module holding all of the Voyager-specific code.
</dl>

<p>
The responder is written in Perl with the code broken down into a set of Perl
modules that work together. The primary “chunks” of code are the daemon (which
deals with network stuff), the responder proper (which parses the message), the
message classes (which instantiate the different types of message objects – see
below), and the Voyager-specific backend code.

<p>
NCIP and SIP are very different beasts, with different message sets and
parameters, and it’s important to maintain a strict separation between
NCIP-savvy and SIP-savvy parts so that no one piece of code has to understand
both.

<p>
As a result, the first thing the NCIP responder does is to translate the
incoming NCIP message (an XML document) into an internal message object; this
contains a subset of the data found in the NCIP message, but in a very
different form. (Only a subset is needed, but which subset – and which form it
takes internally – depends on the particular type of message that was
received.)

<p>
This message object is then handed off to the Voyager-specific backend code,
which typically uses one or more SQL queries to obtain additional information
from Voyager before passing a SIP message to Voyager requesting that it perform
the desired action (place a hold, check an item out, etc.). For example, when
handling the RequestItem message a query is used to turn the ISBN provided into
a bib ID and item barcode, which is what SIP requires when placing a hold.

<p>
The Voyager-specific backend uses what it gets back from Voyager via SIP to
construct a response object, which is returned to the responder proper, which
converts it into the actual XML that goes back to SHAREit.
