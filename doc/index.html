<h1>vncip</h1>

<p>
<b>vncip</b> is an NCIP version 1 responder for the Voyager ILS.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
<li>Linux (installation is geared toward RHEL)
<li>Voyager ILS version 7 or higher (tested only under Voyager 8)
<li>Voyager SIP2, a.k.a. Extended SIP
</ul>

<p>
Other required software will be installed as part of the installation process.
This includes The Z Shell (zsh) and a number of Perl modules, for example:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Net::Server
<li>XML::Simple
<li>YAML
</ul>

<h2>Technical Background</h2>

<p>
NCIP is a protocol for automating circulation and lending tasks &ndash; for
example, a regional ILL service might use NCIP to request items from a lending
ILS and check them out to the borrowing ILS.
</p>

<p>
In an NCIP transaction, the <i>initiator</i> sends a specially formatted
<i>request</i> to a <i>responder</i> asking it to perform some task &ndash; for
example, retrieving information about a patron or placing a hold on an item.
The responder performs the task (if appropriate) and returns a <i>response</i>
to the initiator.
</p>

<p>
Both requests and responses are in an XML form and may consist of a complex
&ldquo;tree&rdquo; of XML elements, most of which are optional.
</p>

<p>
The following illustration shows the message pathways in a typical installation
(the author&rsquo;s):

<p>
Here, <b>Brahma</b> is a server running the SHAREit platform from Auto-Graphics
and <b>Titania</b> is the server on which Voyager is running.  It should be
possible to run <b>vncip</b> on a separate server, but that has not been
tested.
</p>

<h2>Architecture</h2>

<p>
The <b>vncip</b> responder is a system of Perl scripts and modules whose task
is to receive incoming NCIP version 1 requests, figure out what to do with each
request, do it (or ask Voyager to do it), build an appropriate response, and
send the response back to the initiator.
</p>

<p>
Most of what <b>vncip</b> does is delegated to Voyager using SQL queries run
against the Oracle database that stores Voyager&rsquo;s data or via the
extended SIP2 interface that Voyager provides.  For example, checking out an
item to a patron requires gathering information about the patron and the item
using SQL, then using SIP to ask Voyager to check the item out.
</p>

<p>
The code that makes up <b>vncip</b> is divided among several principal
components:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>ncipd</b></dt>
<dd><p>
    The NCIP1 <i>daemon</i> &ndash; this script runs continually and
    &ldquo;drives&rdquo; all of the other components.
</p></dd>
<dt><b>ncipctl</b></dt>
<dd><p>
    A shell script to start and stop <b>ncipd</b>.
</p></dd>
<dt><b>Biblio::NCIP1::Responder</b></dt>
<dd><p>
    The main Perl module, which provides the &ldquo;responder&rdquo; proper.
    The responder coordinates the other Perl modules.
</p></dd>
<dt><b>Biblio::NCIP1::Server</b></dt>
<dd><p>
    A Perl module that listens for incoming connections on the desired network
    port, reads requests that come in, and passes them off to the
    <b>Biblio::NCIP1::Responder</b> object.
</p></dd>
<dt><b>Biblio::NCIP1:Request</b></dt>
<dd><p>
    The Perl module that embodies an NCIP1 request.  It is responsible for
    parsing the XML that comes in from the NCIP initiator.
</p></dd>
<dt><b>Biblio::NCIP1:Response</b></dt>
<dd><p>
    The Perl module that embodies an NCIP1 response.  It is responsible for
    building the XML that will be sent back to the initiator.
</p></dd>
<dt><b>Biblio::NCIP1:Backend::Vger8</b></dt>
<dd><p>
    A Perl module holding all of the Voyager-specific code.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>
<b>vncip</b> begins by translating the XML request into a Perl data structure
