The NCIP connector runs "against" a particular "target".  You can have multiple
targets, if you wish.  Each must have its own config settings in a directory
whose name matches the Voyager instance name (xxxdb), and you must specify a
unique port number for each.

Within each NCIP target there must be four config files; here's what they're
used for...

backend.conf

    This file contains Voyager-specific config settings.  When the NCIP
    connector uses SIP to ask Voyager to do things (place a hold on an item,
    etc.) it does so "as" a Voyager operator and "at" a circulation location,
    so you'll to specify those here.
    
    When it creates a temporary item (when one of your patrons is borrowing an
    item from elsewhere) it must tell Voyager what barcode to use for the item.
    To make sure that this is unique, the NCIP connector uses the request ID
    and a prefix and/or suffix.  The request ID will go where the "%" occurs in
    this config setting.  Choose a prefix or suffix (or both) carefully!

libraries.conf

    The NCIP connector uses Voyager location limit groups to determine whether
    a particular item is lendable -- if an item is not at a "lending" location,
    attempts to request it will be rejected.  In this file you specify which
    location limit group(s) to use.  You'll need one section for each library
    within your institution -- technically one for each "agency" to which NCIP
    messages are addressed.  You'll have to work with the folks who provide the
    NCIP initiator to determine which agency code(s) to use.

locations.conf

    This file lets you disallow loans from particular locations.  It can
    probably be left blank.

server.conf

    This file is where you specify the port at which the NCIP responder will
    accept connections.  There are myriad other settings you can provide, too
    -- see Net::Server(3pm) for more info if you're really, really curious.
